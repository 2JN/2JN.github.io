# A Basic Guide of Concepts You Should Know to Pass the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certificate

After that short title I think there is little to nothing to explain what this article is about, so what if we just get into it?

## AWS Availability Zones

---

Each region in AWS has around three to six Availability Zones (AZ from now on). Each AZ is one or more discrete data centers with redudant
power, networking and connectivity in this way they are separated from disasters. This interconnected AZ will form a **region**.

Three things to take in consideration while picking an AZ are:

- Compliance with the government rules
- Latency
- Price

## AWS Points of Presence (Edge Locations)

---

## AWS IAM

---

The general idea is to grant the least privilege to users. I.E. lowest privilege/permission level possible

**Users**
: Mapped to a physical user, has a password for AWS Console.

**Groups**
: Contains users only which will have access to resources allowed for the specific group.

**Policies**
: JSON document that outlines permissions for users or groups.

**Roles**
: For EC2 instances or AWS Services.

## AWS EC2

---

EC2 is a *virtual server* wich can be lunched in a region of choice. The geographical proximity of the instance to the
users impacts on the latency optimization.

**AMI**

These are customized images that have some specific configurations for an EC2 instance. These like templates to get started on a specific
task more efficiently. These can be created to be sold or purchased by anyone on the AWS store.

**EBS**

Elastic block store is where the data of EC2 instances is saved. This are SSD/HDD devices that are connected to the instances
over the network thrugh the VPC. The EBS has to be on the same AZ as the EC2 instance so they can connect. An EBS can be connected
to a single EC2 but an EC2 can have many EBS connected at the same time [^1]. 

**Security Groups**

Security groups act as a virtual firewall to your server. It can control *incoming* or *outgoing* traffic of the EC2 instance.

[^1]: There is a special EBS that can be connected to multiple EC2 instances.

**Auto Scaling**

Auto scaling enables to automatically expand or shrink your server infrastructure based on your application traffic pattern.

**Scalability**

Scalability means that an application / system can handle greater loads by adapting.

There are two kinds of scalability:
- Vertical scalability: Increase the size of the instance
- Horizontal scalability: Increase the number of instances / systems for the application

**Elasticity**

Means that a system can "auto-scale" based on the load. This is cloud friendly: pay-per-use, match demand, optimeze costs.

**Agility**

New IT resources are jus a click away. Which means that you reduce the time to make resources available from weeks to just minutes.
(Not directly related to scalability, but, it could be a distractor questoin on the test).

## AWS S3

---

Simple Storage Service provides object storage through a web service interface.

**Storage Types**

- S3 Standard: For data that requires high durability, availability & performance for *frequently accessed* data.

- S3 Standard IA: For data that is accessed *less frequently*, but requires rapid access when needed.

- S3 One Zone IA: Unlike other storage classes, which store data in a minimum of three availability zone, S3 One Zone IA stores data in a single AZ.

- Amazon Glacier: Is a low cost storage service for *data archiving*. Glacier objects are NOT available for real time access.

- S3 RRS: Reduced Redundancy Storage, is designed for noncritical reproducible data.
