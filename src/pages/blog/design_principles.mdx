# SOLID Principles

SOLID is a mnemonic for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable.

## Single Responsibility Principle
---

A class should have just one reason to change.

Try to make responsible for a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and make the responsibility entirely encapsulated by the class.

## Open/Close Principle
---

Classes should be opened to extension but close to modification.

A class is open if you can extend it, produce a subclass and do whatever you want with it. At the same time, a class is closed if it's 100% ready to be used by other classes.

## Liskov Substitution Principle
---

When extending a class, you should be able to pass objects of the subclass in place of objects of the parent class without breaking the client code.

This means that the subclass should remain compatible with the behavior of the superclass.

## Interface Segregation Principle
---

Client's shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

Bloated interfaces should be break down into more granular and specific ones.

## Dependency Inversion Principle
---

High-level classes shouldn't depend on low-level classes. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions shouldn't depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.


# Software Patterns

All patterns can be categorized by their intent, or purpose:
- Creational patterns
- Structural patterns
- Behavioral patterns
